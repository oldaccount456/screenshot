# Screenshot Tool

## Information

- This is an easy to use screenshot tool that screenshots any website you give it. Built with NextJS, can be hosted for free on Vercel. 

- If you wish to use screenshotlayer.com as a provider, set SS_LAYER_ACCESS_KEY in your .env file to your api key you get from the site. It's free to register for one, but if you want to remove that provider altogether then remove it from screenshotProvider.js.

- If you are running this locally, you will have to edit screenshotProvider.js and set executablePath to your local chrome executable. 


## Features

- Lets you use internal code to screenshot a website using puppeteer with support for other providers such as screenshotlayer.com

- Updates image smoothly, without reloading the page.

- Can click on the image to see it in full-screen


# Plans

- None, but I'm open to any ideas :-)
